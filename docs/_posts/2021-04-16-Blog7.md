`Snort` is most well known as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). From the snort.org website:

SNORT® is an open source network intrusion detection system capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks. Snort is comprised of two major components: a detection engine that utilizes modular plug-in architecture (the “Snort Engine”) and a flexible rule language to describe traffic to be collected (the “Snort Rules”).

Snort can essentially run in three different modes. IDS Mode, Logging Mode, and Sniffer Mode. 

Default Snort installation comes with lots of rules, which are able to detect all kinds of suspicious and irregular network activity.


      `snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i h1-eth0`
      
Let's take a look at the options. -A is for "alerts", we are telling Snort to display them on the console. The -c option points to the configuration file, where the protected ("home") network, paths to the rule files, and lots and lots of other settings are specified. Finally, -i specifies the network interface.

Snort reserves a special file for custom rules, that is left blank by default. Open it with the Nano text editor as follows:


          sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
