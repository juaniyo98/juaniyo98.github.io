`InSSIDer` is a wireless network scanner that is designed to overcome the limitation of another tool. The name of that tool is NetStumbler. The tool used to be open source, but now you can get for around $19.99. This Wi-Fi scanner app can do several tasks like finding open Wi-Fi access points, tracking the signal strength, saving logs with GPS records, collect data from wireless cards and software, and choose the best wireless channel available. This tool offers many more set ups. You can also diagnose and fix those problems with your Wi-Fi connection. If you get the Plus version, you can also visualize your whole Wi-Fi environment. This tool is used by cybersecuirty experts and/or hackers to analyze the network and what networks are around you. The closer a network is, the easier for a hacker is to crack. This tool does not provide any cracking option, it is just to analyze.

`Cain & Abel` is a really popular password cracking tool developed to intercept network traffic and then discover passwords by brute forcing them using cryptanalysis attack methods. This tool can also recover wireless network keys by analyzing routing protocols. This tool is a password recovery tool for Microsoft Operating Systems. It will sniff the network, record VoIP conversations, revealing password boxes, and many more amazing things it can do. This tool is actually used in the exploit phase of penetration testing since it has lots of options that are useful when hacking WiFi. It lets you analyze SSIDs near you, see what kind of encryption it has, and then crack them.

`Aircrack-ng` is one of the most popular wireless password cracking tools, which can help you crack passwords by cracking WEP keys of Wi-Fi 802.11b network. This tool uses the best algorithms to recover wireless passwords by capturing packets. Once the packets have been captured, it tries to recover it. To make the attack faster, it implements a standard FMS attack with some changes. If you use a Linux Distribution, it will require a better understanding of Linux. You can use airodump-ng to check for networks around you, but your adapter has to be in promiscuous mode. Then, you can use aircrack-ng to crack the password once you colelct enough packages.

`CoWPAtty` is an automated dictionary attack tool for WPA-PSK that runs on Linux Operating System. This tool has a command line interface and runs on a word-list that contains the password to use in the attack. The tool is really simple to use, but it is really slow because it uses SHA1 with a seed of SSID. That means the same password will have a different SSIM, so you cannot use the rainbow table against all access points. So, the tool uses the password dictionary and generates the hack for each word contained in the dictionary by using the SSID. This tool can be used less since all of the tools above are used more often and do the same job as well, but CoWPAtty is a powerfull command line tool that can easily hack WiFi networks.
