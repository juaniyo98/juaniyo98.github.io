`Hashing`

•	A digital fingerprint is a fixed-length binary number represent the uniqueness of a given piece of data 

      o	Also referred to as a digital has or a message digest 
      
•	A one-way hash function is one where you cannot get the data from the hash or the digital fingerprint like MD5 or SHA-512

•	This protects integrity of the message since the hash is unique and if it changes, that means the message has changed 

•	We need to protect against MITM attacks where an entity that intentionally intercepts or changes the original message. 

      o	Hashing protects you from this 

•	Data integrity is the data that was received is the data that was supposed to be received.

      o	This is achieved through hashing 
      
      
      
      `Secure Hash Function`

•	Three rules for secure one-way hash functions:

      o	You can’t easily predict the hash value of a given piece of data
      o	Collisions must be extremely rare
      o	If the data changes, then its hash value will also change when re-hashed
      
•	The Header checksum (16-bit) on the IP header or TCP header will check the checksum of the message so it makes sure what you got it is what the other party sent.

      o	Even UDP has it, but it is rarely used and normally has value of all 0s
      
      
     ` How to Safely Distribute a Shared Secret Key?`

1.	Encrypt using both public/private key (both must have keys and it is slow)

      a.	If you use private key to encrypt, you are basically signing the message
      b.	Then you encrypt the signature with Alice’s public key so she can only decrypt it with her private key and then use bob’s public key to finish decryption
    
2.	TLS/SSL

      a.	Only server identity must be verified (containing certificate containing public key)
      b.	Client need not to have own key pair
      c.	Used by https
      
3.	Difffie-Hellman

      a.	Key agreement, rather than key transmission
      b.	Netither party needs public/private key pair ( although keys
