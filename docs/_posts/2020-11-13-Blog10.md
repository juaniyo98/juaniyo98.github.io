`SolarWinds` Access Rights Manager (ARM) is created to enable scalability by providing a central place for IT compliance management and to assess the company’s greatest security risks. From users authorizations to access permissions, ARM produces custom cybersecurity risks management reports for the user that will alert you if the accounts are created with insecure configurations or rules. With so many constantly evolving compliance drivers, like GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA regulations, scaling to meet IT risk and security assessment requirements can feel impossible. This tool will help with all of those regulations to make the company succeed. 

Detecting IT risks before they’re exploited is the most effective way to protect data. Unfortunately, it’s not always easy to discover which user accounts may present insider risks, or what level access they have to sensitive data. With SolarWinds ARM, you can easily review user provisioning and permissions to servers, files, and folders across your AD infrastructure. With this level of granularity, you can address IT risk exposures quickly by automatically deprovisioning access, requiring two-factor authentication, or enabling secure rights delegation. It will help you to analyze and make sure your audit is correct.
