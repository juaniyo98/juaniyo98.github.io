`Wireshark` is an open-source platform network protocol analyzer. This application will allow you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file or disk. Wireshark has some interesting and powerful feature like the ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session and it even includes a language for filtering display. This amazing application supports almost every protocol. It can be used to sniff networks and capture the traffic of your target or to check that your network is clean and there are no intruders. Here is an example of a traffic capture in wireshark:

`John the Ripper` is a free and open-source software. It is a really fast password cracker that is available for many operating systems like Windows, Unix, and even DOS. This software will detect weak passwords in UNIX systems, and other platforms as well. John the Ripper combines a number of password crackers into one package, autodetects passwords hash types, and has a customizable cracker. It has default lists you can use to automate the cracking process and it can crack hashes as well. Here is an example of using the tool to crack a password:

`Netcat` is a software or utility that simply reads and writes data across TCP and UDP networks connections. It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to use directly. This amazing software has also a network debugging and exploration tool. You can also have the ability to use any local source port and any locally configured network source address. It has a featured tunneling mode which permits user-defined tunneling and it can do other things like connect to a socket and be used as a banner grabber. Here is an example of a way of using netcat to banner grab:

`Nessus` is one of the most popular and capable vulnerability scanners which used to be free, but now it costs $2,190 per year. There is a free version named Nessus Home. Nessus allows to scan vulnerabilities that allow a hacker to control sensitive data on a system. It can also scan for denials of service against TCP/IP stack by using malformed packets and it scans for preparation for well-known audits that companies use to keep their data protected like PCI DSS. This is a really powerfull tool for businesses. Here are some vulnerabilities detected by Nessus:

`Metasploit` is a framework made by Rapid7 that allows you to use prebuild exploits that can be use to attacks other machines that have known vulnerabilities. This is a really useful tool since you, the attacker, do not have to do much but fill out some basic information about the target like the source IP and then it will automate everything for you. If the target is vulnerable to the selected exploit, your target will get exploited and you can get things like a reverse shell. You need to use this tool with permission since it can be easily detected and it is illegal to attack other machines without permission. This framework has thousands of exploits that are categorized as auxiliary, exploits, or post-exploits depending on the kind of attack you are doing. Here is the action of running an exploit:
