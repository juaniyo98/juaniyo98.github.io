The Domain Name Service (DNS) is a protocol that maps a domain name like www.google.com to IP addresses like 10.1.1.1 so humans do not have to memorize all of the available IPs. Humans understand better words than numbers and that is what DNS is for. You can also have a reverse DNS lookup which will be mapping an IP to a domain name.

Attackers sometimes take advantage of DNS because if you control the DNS server or cache you can map your target to any domain of your choice. For example, let's say you control the DNS server of your target. You can add a line with the IP of Google.com that maps to the IP of the target. Like this:
           
           `8.8.8.8       evilwebsite.com`
  
There are two really important tools when it comes to DNS enumeration and finding any kind of record that might be important to a penetration tester, company, or hacker. These two tools are dig and DNSRecon. They do different things but they target the same service, which is the Domain Name Service.
