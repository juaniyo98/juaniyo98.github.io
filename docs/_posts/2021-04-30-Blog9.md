`Symmetric Cryptography` (DES, 3DES, AES, …)

        - Each user has the same key, used to encrypt or decrypt the data 
        - The encryption/decryption algorithms are built out of basic ciphers, with the key controlling how the ciphers are applied
        - The key is secret and without it, you need to brute force the key.
        - Encrypted data can be sent on an insecure data without being read 
        - The bad thing is that the public key has to be shared somehow like in telephone.

`Asymmetric (Public Key) Cryptography`

      - Each side has a public key and a private key:
            a) Public Key: Everyone may know this key
            b) Private Key: Only the holder knows their own private key
      - Data encrypted with a public key can be decrypted with corresponding private key
      - What public locks, private key unlocks
      - What private locks, public key unlocks
      - Only I can know my private key or else no security
      - The Problem with this method is that it is very slow and time-consuming and it can be 5000 times slower
      - To improve the speed, you can share a session key by encrypting with Bob’s private key and with Alice’s public key. Once Alice decrypts it, they can use the shared session key and it will speed up everything.
      
      
`What is a session key?`

A session key is any encryption key used to symmetrically encrypt one communication session only. In other words, it's a temporary key that is only used once, during one stretch of time, for encrypting and decrypting data; future conversations between the two parties would be encrypted with different session keys. A session key is like a password that someone resets every time they log in.
a session key is a cryptographic key that is used for encrypting the bulk of transmitted data and ensuring integrity of the data
