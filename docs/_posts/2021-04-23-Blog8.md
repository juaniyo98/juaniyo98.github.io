In this blog, I am going to talk about some tips that you can follow to secure a Windows system. These are basic things to do and should be implemented as a mechanism to stop attacks to your system. Always know that you need to have a balance between security and commodity because the more secure a machine is, the less easy to use is. But if you find a middle point, you can enjoy your system at the same time it is secure.

When we compete in the `Cyber Colligeate Defense Competition`, we apply these rule as soon as we get onto our machines. If you memorize this, this things will come really easy. Some of the rules to follow are:

    1) Windows has a guest default account
          - Change the password, disable it ore remove it, and/or change its name
          - Remove accounts that are not suppose to be there
          
    2) Change passwords of accounts that are supposed to be there
   
    3) Passwords must follow strong complexity 
          - Change these in local policy or group policy settings
          - Enforce password history ( 10-25)
          - Maximum password age (30-60 )
          - Minimum password age (1-5)
          - Minimum password length ( 8-20)
          - Password must meet complexity ( Enable)
          - Store passwords using reversible encryption (Disable)

    4) Change the name of the administrator account for security purposes

    5)Uninstall malicious software or programs that are not supposed to be there
    
    6)Install Firefox and a malware protection software
          - Malwarebytes
          
    7)Install updates but do not restart until the end ( try to do this at the beginning of the competition
    
    8)Delete suspicious files
    
    9)Check the name, date that it was created, modified, and maybe run it against Malwarebytes.

    10) Enable Windows Firewall
    
    11) Disable and stop services that are not necessary or can be dangerous like:
            - RDP
            - ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) â€“ allows a computer with internet connection to share its connection with the rest of computers in the same LAN
            - Remote registry
